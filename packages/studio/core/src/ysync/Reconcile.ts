// Deterministic, constraint-aware reconciliation of a box graph.
//
// Yjs converges every client on the SAME document but has no notion of the box graph's referential
// invariants (a pointer must resolve, an exclusive target accepts at most one incoming pointer, ...). So a
// merged document can encode a state that is illegal for the graph. Applied naively, endTransaction throws
// and YSync reverts locally — and because each client reverts to a DIFFERENT local state, the peers fork.
//
// The cure is not to teach Yjs the rules but to repair the illegal state with a function that is PURE in the
// converged document: every client, seeing the same document, runs the same repair and lands on the same
// graph. The only inputs allowed are data present on every client — box uuids and field addresses — never
// wall-clock time or message arrival order. Repairs run to a fixpoint (one repair can expose another).
//
// PROTOTYPE SCOPE: exclusive-target overflow (the case the collab tests show diverging). Dangling pointers
// and mandatory-missing are cheap to add on the same skeleton; each just needs its own deterministic rule.
